## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

Navigating the file structure was initially challenging as this was only my second React project. Throughout development, I encountered a learning curve with React's unique way of handling components and state, which differs from traditional HTML/CSS. Mastering props and state management was particularly enlightening, offering a deeper understanding of dynamic web application development.
